EXAMPLE OF A VERY SIMPLE TWITTER BOT POWERED BY JUST ONE LINE OF BASH
=====================================================================

This particular bot randomly tweets a quote from the novel "Fight Club" by Chuck
Palahniuk.

REQUIREMENTS
    * `twurl` to access Twitter API: https://github.com/twitter/twurl
        * it's a ruby program which need you to install `ruby` and `rubygems`
          or `ruby-dev` (depending on your distribution)
        * then install it with `gem install twurl`
    * Create a Twitter app and add it to twurl with the following command:
      `twurl authorize -c '[consumer key]' -s '[consumer secret key]'`
      (see `twurl -T` for a tutorial)

HOW IT WORKS
    * We simply store all the possible tweets into a text file (here named
      "fc.txt"), one tweet per line.
    * With a simple one-liner, we can then tweet whatever we want from this file,
      picking a random line:
        $ twurl -d "status=$(shuf -n 1 /path/to/fc.txt)" /1.1/statuses/update.json
    * We can now store this command into a script that would get executed on a
      regular basis through a job scheduler like 'cron' (here named "tweet.sh")

USAGE
    $ ./tweet.sh              # tweets a quote
    $ ./fc-random-quote.sh    # prints a quote
