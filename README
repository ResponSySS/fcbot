EXAMPLE OF A VERY SIMPLE TWITTER BOT POWERED BY JUST ONE LINE OF BASH
=====================================================================

This particular bot randomly tweets a quote from the novel "Fight Club" by Chuck
Palahniuk.

REQUIREMENTS
    * The (superior) minimalist Python Twitter API, plus its command-line utility
      found at: http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/

HOW TO INSTALL
    * Installation of the minimalist Python Twitter API requires Python's 
      'setuptools'; you can probably install it through your package manager.
        $ sudo { apt-get install | pacman -S | ... } python-setuptools
    * Install the minimalist Python Twitter API through 'easy_install' (provided
      by 'setuptools'; see: http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/)
        $ sudo easy_install twitter
    * Prepare the Twitter API to interact with your account through OAuth
      permission; this is simply done by using the command-line tool 'twitter'
      for the first time with the '--oauth' argument:
        $ twitter --oauth {OAUTH_FILE}
      (where OAUTH_FILE is a filename to store OAuth credentials to)

HOW IT WORKS
    * We simply store all the possible tweets into a text file (here named
      "fc.txt"), one tweet per line.
    * With a simple one-liner, we can then tweet whatever we want from this file,
      picking a random line:
        $ shuf -n 1 /path/to/fc.txt | twitter --oauth {OAUTH_FILE} set
    * We can now store this command-line into a script that would get executed on
      a regular basis through a job scheduler like 'cron' (here named "tweet.sh")

USAGE
    $ ./tweet.sh              # tweets a quote
    $ ./fc-random-quote.sh    # prints a quote
